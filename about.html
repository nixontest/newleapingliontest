								<h2>About Us</h2>-->
							</header>
							<p>We are Leaping Lion Books: a micro-publishing, independent press residing at York University in Toronto, Canada. Our press is managed by fourth-year students in York’s Professional Writing program who are given the opportunity of hands-on experience. These students will put their skills and knowledge to the test within a real-life publishing environment. Each year, students are given a manuscript that is selected by the course director, Mike O’Connor, and are responsible for transforming that manuscript into a book. They edit, design, produce and market the book––with limited guidance from the course director––while accenting the book with the uniqueness of the Leaping Lions brand. For more information on the individual departments and their responsibilities you can go <a href=" careers.html"> here</a>.</p>

							<p>But, to give you a bit of history behind the press, for interest’s sake, here’s the background. Leaping Lion was first created in 2009 by Prof. Geoffrey Huck, an Associate Professor in the Writing Department at York University for the purpose of giving students an inside look behind the real-life workings of a publishing house. The press accepts manuscripts from all genres. To give you an idea of what it has published since 2009 here’s a few genres it published books in: crime, film criticisms, plays, and history.</p>

							<p>The common thread that links all books Leaping Lion publishes annually to the press itself is by its double-edged sword. It’s openness to allowing all forms of written art to enter through its doors and get published, and its dedication to all of York’s student body to allow them to have the experience of becoming a published author before they even graduate. Why is that important? Because if they ever enter the publishing industry they’ll already have a track record for employers to look at and, thus, publishers in the real world are more likely to take them versus another with no publishing experience.</p>
