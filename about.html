								<h2>About Us</h2>-->
							</header>
							<p>We are Leaping Lion Books: a micro-publishing, independent press residing at York University in Toronto, Canada. Our press is managed by fourth-year students in York’s Professional Writing program who are given the opportunity of hands-on experience. These students will put their skills and knowledge to the test within a real-life publishing environment. Each year, students are given a manuscript that is selected by the course director, Mike O’Connor, and are responsible for transforming that manuscript into a book. They edit, design, produce and market the book––with limited guidance from the course director––while accenting the book with the uniqueness of the Leaping Lions brand.</p>

							<p>Leaping Lions Books encompasses five (5) major departments that taken together design, edit, and publish a book by the end of each year. These departments consist of the business department, marketing, design, web design, and publishers, themselves, who oversee what each department is doing and make sure everything runs smoothly, so the eventual book is published on time.</p>

							<p>Despite the fact that the publishers control everything that goes on at every stage of the book’s production, each department nonetheless works individually and collaborates when needed. </p>

							<p>So, business is concerned with the book’s financial aspects, the cost to produce the book from simple manuscript form versus its potential to sell big. Marketing is concerned with the best ways in which to attract as wide an audience as they can when the book is ready for sale. Marketing oftentimes has a close relationship with the design team who design the cover of the book to see how, visually, the book can become more appealing to as many people as possible. To round it off, the web designers help in making the book known in the online world by designing an online platform for the book where visitors can check out the summary, reviews, and anything else pertaining to a particular book.</p>
