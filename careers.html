							<p>Hey, hey, hey! Come join Leaping Lion Books!
Leaping Lion Books, which works in conjunction with the WRIT 4004 6.0 Book Publishing Practicum, is a student-run book publishing ‘company’. We focus mainly on trade books and highlight experiential learning of the bookmaking process. As an ’employee’ of Leaping Lion Books, you can choose from an array of positions and work alongside other students who are passionate about a future in book publishing. You could ‘work’ as the publisher overseeing the tasks of a whole publishing firm, as editorial director helping to bring a manuscript to maturity, or a production director working to prepare the presentation of a book-to-be for its walk down the altar. For more information on positions available at Leaping Lion Books, please see the F/W 2017/2018 Leaping Lion Books Publishing [team hyperlink].</p>


<p>For Writers (who want to submit their manuscripts)
Are you a writer with a book plan or an initial manuscript? Do you have a dream of being published one day? Do you want to express your unique style or story through words? Well then, Leaping Lion Books can accept your unsolicited manuscript with open arms!</p>
<p>Leaping Lion Books at York University is looking for inspiring and interesting manuscript submissions. Your submission could be seen by the course director, Mike O'Connor, who could then hand it over to the WRIT 4004 Practicum class he teaches to be edited, marketed and finally published by Leaping Lion Books. You can submit fiction or non-fiction manuscripts, but be ready to work with the students to take it through to maturity because, after all, you have all the expertise in the subject matter, not them.</p>

<p>In the past Leaping Lion Books has published Nic Labriola’s Francis and the Animals, Donna Jean MacKinnon’s Newsgirls, Stan Rogal’s Obsessions, and many others.  Currently, Leaping Lion Books is working with Prof. Arthur Haberman, a Professor Emeritus at York University’s History Department, on his manuscript Wild Justice which is due for release to the general public in April 2018.</p>
