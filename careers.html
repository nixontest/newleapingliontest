<center><p><b> Come join Leaping Lion Books! </b></p></center>
<p> Leaping Lion Books works in conjunction with WRIT 4004 Book Publishing Practicum. This Practicum allows students in their 4th year to participate in the publication of a book of short fiction. Manuscripts are chosen from submissions to a contest, edited, produced in both electronic and print editions, and marketed, all under the supervision of Professional Writing faculty. Students must grapple with issues from how to judge the publishability of a manuscript to how best to edit, produce, and market an appropriate text. Assessment is through written assignments associated with the publishing tasks the students perform. As an employee of Leaping Lion Books you can choose from an array of positions and work alongside other students who are passionate about a future in book publishing.</p>
